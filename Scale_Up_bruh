Explain how you will use one of the NoSQL database categories to prepare for use of you project at a large scale.

Tell a story about how your application might grow too large for a relational database, 
and which kind of NoSQL database you think would be best to use to handle the increased popularity.

Each individual should submit this, and if you work together as a team the submissions might be the same. 
But, feel free to put you own personal spin on what you think might happen with your application 
and what your team should do to prepare for it.

Scale up notes:
Transactions would need to be the category that would be the most heavily used

Story:
Due to World War III breaking out in Egypt and Kenya, the world was in need of managing the money for the war.
The U.S. government was floundering around not knowing how to handle its increase in spending. It needed a large-scale
solution. They turned to the number one customizable budget company in the world, Budget Control. Our company
now has billions of transactions to record and display for the expenses that have come due to the war effort. 
At first, our relational database was under too much strain when it comes to reading and writing transactions 
from the government. So, we transitioned to a NoSQL database to handle the increased traffic. 
The category of our NoSQL database is a key-value / document database. We decided to use the DynamoDB 
hosted by AWS. It is a key-value / document database format. We want to use key-value because of the speed
and simplicity it provides. The document portion will provide flexibility to larger values that need to be stored.
