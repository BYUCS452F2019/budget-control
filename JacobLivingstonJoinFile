Budet-Control Pitch Response
Hello,
  I am very interested in your project. This is something that I have been wanting to create, but haven't had the time to do so. On the side I have created a bank-statement parser, and I have also done extensive spreadsheet work on our budget, but it takes way too much time to maintain. 
  I have extensive back-end development and architecture experience. I have used several frameworks that will speed up the development process but also allow for more functionality. I have a fair amount of experience setting up rest-api's for the front end to query. 
  Recently, I have been learning react and react-native for a side-project that I am involved in. While I am not the best with making it look really pretty, I can create a functional front-end without making it look ugly. 
  I also have experience with firebase, beyond the scope of CS260. I have used SQL for CS240 and CS340, and I am willing to learn more about how to optimize it.

  I really like your plan to make it suited for our needs. I can see that as we make it, we might want to generify it to a certain degree, but the best tools are the ones you create for yourself that have all the functionality you desire, and don't includefunctionality that isn't needed. 

I look forward to working with you.

Sincerely

Jacob Livingston
