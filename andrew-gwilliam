response to budget-control

I like this project idea for a few reasons, mostly because 
I agree that there isn't a great solution out there currently 
that allows for a lot of customization (without advertisements 
or a paywall). For example, I've used Mint in the past but
it's become so bloated and covered in advertisements
for credit cards that I find it difficult to use.

As far as my qualifications and what I can contribute,
I worked this summer building a tool from scratch using
Angular with a Java backend for a fairly large financial
company. I agree that a website would be good for this 
project and am familiar with web development. 
I'm a hard worker, take school seriously, all the stuff.

I agree with the notion to keep it personal to a few people.
There's no need to get into the details of a business plan 
and potential legal ramifications of storing financial information.
